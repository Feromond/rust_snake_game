## About The Project

This project is intended to be a simple game version of snake created in rust. Just a way for me to learn the rust programming languge and practice it.
The goal of this project is to create a snake game with collisions, score, snake growth. Future plans would be to keep track of highscores, and to improve potentially textures and assets to be used instead of just square shapes.

## Release Notes:

### rust_snake_game_release

The first initial release includes a snake game with boarder collisions, self collisions, food, and snake growth, as well as a score that increases each time you get food.
The escape key can be used to quit the game at anytime. Currently the game auto quits when you crash / die in the game. I will want to add a end screen in the future.
